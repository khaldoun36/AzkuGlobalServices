This project involved the installation of a state-of-the-art corrosion monitoring system (CMS) for a 105-kilometer crude oil pipeline, as part of a strategic initiative to enhance the integrity of critical crude lines in Iraq. The comprehensive project scope encompassed engineering, procurement, installation of the CMS, as well as the necessary training and handover to the client. The specific activities executed during the project include:

- Comprehensive Pipeline Route Survey: A thorough survey was conducted along the 105-kilometer crude oil pipeline route to assess the condition of the pipeline and identify potential areas of corrosion vulnerability.
- Intelligent Pigging Report Analysis: A detailed analysis was performed on the results of the previous intelligent pigging of the pipeline, which identified areas of corrosion and structural damage to the pipeline.
- Detailed Engineering Studies: Comprehensive engineering studies were undertaken to design the mechanical, pipeline, instrumentation, and civil aspects of the state-of-the-art CMS system to be installed, ensuring compliance with industry standards and project specifications.
- Procurement and Logistics: The necessary equipment and materials for the CMS system were procured from reputable suppliers, ensuring quality and timely delivery to the project site.
- Installation and Commissioning: The CMS system was meticulously installed along the pipeline route, followed by rigorous commissioning processes to ensure optimal functionality and adherence to project specifications.
- Comprehensive Training and Handover: Extensive training was provided to the client's personnel, ensuring their proficiency in operating and maintaining the CMS system. Upon successful completion of training, the CMS system was formally handed over to the client.

The successful execution of this project demanded seamless collaboration between the client, contractors, engineers, and project management teams. The end result is a state-of-the-art and reliable CMS system that will enable continuous monitoring and early detection of corrosion along the 105-kilometer crude oil pipeline, safeguarding the integrity of this critical infrastructure.
