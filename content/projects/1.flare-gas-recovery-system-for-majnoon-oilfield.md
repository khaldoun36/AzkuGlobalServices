This project involved the design, procurement, supply, installation, and commissioning of two-stage low-pressure (LP) and medium-pressure (MP) gas compressors and their associated accessories. These accessories included knock-out drums, air-cooled heat exchangers, condensate pumps/vessels, dedicated field unit control panels (UCPs), machine monitoring systems (MMS), field instruments, utility connections, structural supports, interconnecting piping, and electrical accessories.

For the successful project completion, the following measures were taken by AGS:

- Process analysis and safety studies like HAZOP, HAZID & SIL.
- Material selection, Bow-tie, Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA), ALARP and Noise studies.
- Design and layout to ensure optimal equipment arrangement.
- 3D modelling and review with a virtual representation of the components and their installation.
- Preliminary and detailed engineering were conducted to ensure a safe and effective installation.
- Procurement of the necessary components from proprietary manufacturers.
- Local Iraqi construction services utilized for the installation process.
- Cost and scheduling were managed to ensure the project was completed within budget and on time.
- Quality assurance and quality control were implemented to ensure the project was completed to a high standard.
