This project involved comprehensive Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) management services for the design and delivery of a multi-stage gas compression system. The system comprised three compression stages: low-pressure (LP), medium-pressure (MP), and high-pressure (HP). Additionally, the project encompassed other mechanical equipment packages, including pressure vessels, pump skids, heat exchangers, flare systems for LP and HP stages, structural sheds, fire-fighting systems, and a seal gas compressor with a sorbent-based H2S removal unit. Electrical and instrumentation auxiliaries, such as switchgears, distribution panels, transformers, field instruments, junction boxes, cables, and accessories, were also part of the project scope.

To successfully execute this project, the following activities were undertaken:

- Detailed engineering was conducted for the compression system and auxiliary equipment to ensure efficient operation, compliance with safety regulations, and adherence to industry standards.

- Procurement activities were meticulously managed to ensure the timely and cost-effective acquisition of all required equipment and materials.

- Construction management was executed with precision to ensure the successful installation and commissioning of the compression system and auxiliary equipment.

- Electrical and instrumentation installation was completed to ensure the proper functioning of the compression system and auxiliary equipment.

- Stringent quality control measures were implemented throughout the project lifecycle to ensure that all components met the required standards and that the project exceeded industry and safety benchmarks.

The successful completion of this project required meticulous planning, efficient execution, and effective communication among all stakeholders involved. The end result is a high-quality, reliable gas compression system and auxiliary equipment designed to serve its intended purpose for years to come.
