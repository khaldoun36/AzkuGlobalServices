Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) management for the design and supply of a multi-stage gas compressor system. This system consisted of three stages of compression, namely the low-pressure (LP), medium-pressure (MP), and high-pressure (HP) stages. Additionally, the project included other mechanical equipment packages that consisted of pressure vessels, pump skids, heat exchangers, flare packages for both the LP and HP stages, structural sheds, firefighting systems, and a seal gas compressor with a sorbent-type H2S removal unit. Electrical and instrumentation auxiliaries were also included.

In taking on this project, AGS team were required to handle multiple core EPC activities including:

- Detailed engineering for the compressor system and auxiliary equipment to ensure efficient operation and compliance with safety regulations and industry standards.
- Procurement activities to ensure the timely and cost-effective acquisition of equipment and materials required for the project.
- Construction management to ensure the successful installation and commissioning of the
  compressor system and auxiliary equipment.
- Electrical and instrumentation installation to ensure the proper functioning of the compressor system and auxiliary equipment.
- Quality control implemented throughout the project to ensure that all components were of the required standard and that the project met or exceeded industry and safety standards.
