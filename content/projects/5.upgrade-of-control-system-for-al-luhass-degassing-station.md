The scope of this project involved the complete replacement of an outdated Distributed Control System (DCS) at the Al-Luhais degassing station in Basra. This required the full range of engineering, procurement, construction, and demolition (EPCD) services to be delivered to ensure the successful replacement of the system.

- Engineering: Detailed engineering studies were conducted to determine the best approach for replacing the DCS system in addition to that ,3D model was conducted for the whole facility , and reverse engineering was carried out for all missing drawings and data.
- Procurement: The procurement of materials required for the project was carried out.
- Construction: The installation of the new ICSS, control valves, and field instruments was carried out in a systematic and efficient manner. This included the construction of any necessary infrastructure, such as control rooms and other facilities.
- Demolition: The old DCS system, control valves, and field instruments were dismantled and safely disposed of as part of the project.
