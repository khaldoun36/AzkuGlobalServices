The project encompassed the procurement, installation, and construction management of 32 kilometers of Fibrespar non-metallic flowlines, configured in a dual-line arrangement. The comprehensive scope of work incorporated the following critical tasks:

- Procurement of the flowlines to ensure adherence to project specifications and timelines.

- Logistical oversight for the seamless delivery of materials to the designated construction site.

- Stringent health, safety, and environmental (HSE) management protocols to maintain a secure and sustainable work environment.

- Supervision of rigorous testing and commissioning procedures to validate the operational readiness and compliance of the flowlines with applicable industry standards.

- Facilitation of tank farm integration aligning with project requirements.

The procurement phase entailed a meticulous acquisition process for the flowlines, ensuring their timely availability at the construction site. The installation works were diligently executed under strict HSE guidelines, prioritizing the well-being of personnel and minimizing environmental impact. The project team meticulously oversaw the testing and commissioning stages, verifying the flowlines' functionality and adherence to specified performance criteria.
